# TON Bounties Program Guidelines


## Propose a bounty task

All the bounty tasks are initially published and discussed on GitHub.

### Ideation Stage
1. Open a GitHub [**bounty issue**](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/new/choose). It's important to choose a proper category for your bounty task.
2. Name the GitHub issue with a title that properly describes your proposal.
3. Fill in GitHub issue fields and publish it.
   
### Review Stage
1. The community can comment, discuss, and suggest changes to the proposed bounty task. Make sure you contribute to spreading the word about your new bounty task suggestion - the feedback of the community will ensure the importance of the task.
2. TON Bounties [**committee**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#ton-footsteps-committee) regularly reviews proposals. The committee labels an issue `approved` if approved. Otherwise, they close it.
3. After receipt of the label `approved`, the bounty task is approved for implementation but has not yet been assigned to the executor.
