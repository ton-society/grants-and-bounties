# Grant program guidelines

TON Grants Program is aimed at providing initial support for ambitious teams to kick off product development or migrate a successful existing product to TON from another blockchain.

*Currently, our grant focus is on DeFi projects within TON ecosystem. Weâ€™re supporting developers building innovative DeFi solutions like decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and yield farming platforms. This grant offers funding and resources to accelerate growth and adoption. If your project advances decentralized finance, this is your chance to gain support and make an impact. Click [here for more details](https://www.notion.so/1115274bd2cf80f0b639f84f3914356a?pvs=21)* 

Apart from that, we always welcome initiatives that help enhance TON overall infrastructure &  facilitate the deployment of and interaction across DApps and Telegram Mini Apps, bring a unique value to the ecosystem and attract users and financial value from outside of TON.

It is important to note that we do not support products that do not have an MVP or fail to show the unique value proposition and are identical to the ones that already exist on TON. Instead, we focus on novel innovative business cases, even if within the same product vertical, but that promise to disrupt the landscape and have a clear marketing strategy to deliver that.

Applicants are thus invited to carefully studyÂ [TON Ecosystem map](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map)Â as the first obligatory step in the application process.

# **Generally, your proposal will have better chances to be accepted if:**

- It presents aÂ **clear description**Â of the problem and your solution to it, and the proposed concept is well-researched and tested by the team. Priority will be given to projects that are able to demonstrate some early user traction (commercial use cases) or at least some technical work conducted (infrastructural cases).
- Your team hasÂ **proven business experience**Â in the respective field as well as the technical knowledge of relevant languages and technologies. Please note that we prioritise backing established teams with a proven track record of working together, and not solo developers. When describing your team, focus on the relevantÂ **achievements and numbers**, showcasing the commercial traction that your previous products have.
- There is an early **MVP or prototype** for the Grant team to assess.
- You effectively explain yourÂ **user acquisition plan**. Applications without a clear go-to-market strategy will NOT be considered.
- The application includes enough details on theÂ **functionality**Â of your DApp / tool.
- You break down your project intoÂ **specific milestones**Â with reasonable timelines and expected outcomes and deliverables for each phase. Note that we do NOT provide grants for research, so please make sure not to include research activities among your milestones.
- A detailed andÂ **reasonable budget**Â breakdown is provided. Justify each expense and ensure it aligns with industry standards - otherwise the proposal will be rejected. Please note that the requested budget in your proposal must not exceed $50K (except for the DeFi category).
- You can demonstrate that the project will beÂ **maintained**Â after the completion of the grant, be it through additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- You can clearly present how your projectÂ **stands out among competitors**Â and implements the technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet. Thoroughly think about your unique value proposition for the users of TON and explain how your solution is better than any product that exists either on TON or on other chains (please feel free to mention specific projects). We highlight again that a necessary step before submitting your application is to explore theÂ [TON Ecosystem Map.](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map)Â We are happy to support multiple solutions in the same product vertical, but your differentiation must be clear.
